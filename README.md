# Faye Travel Insurance: Award-Winning Digital Protection, Instant Claims, 24/7 Support

So here's the thing about travel insurance – most people either skip it entirely or end up with some complicated policy they don't really understand. I get it. Traditional travel insurance feels like reading a legal contract written in another language.

But Faye? They've basically looked at everything annoying about travel insurance and said, "Yeah, let's fix that."

## What Makes Faye Different

Faye launched in early 2022, right when the world was cautiously reopening after COVID-19. The timing wasn't a coincidence – they saw how much travelers actually needed protection, but also how frustrating the old-school insurance companies were to deal with.

Here's what caught my attention: TIME magazine named Faye one of their Best Inventions of 2025. Not "best travel insurance," mind you – Best Inventions overall. That's saying something.

The whole operation runs through an app. And before you roll your eyes at yet another app taking up space on your phone, this one actually makes sense. Everything from getting a quote to filing a claim happens right there. No phone trees, no mailing paperwork, no waiting weeks for someone to process your forms.

## Coverage That Actually Covers Things

Faye keeps it simple – they offer one comprehensive plan instead of making you choose between "Basic," "Premium," and "Super Ultra Deluxe Plus" options. Smart move, honestly.

Here's what that single plan includes:

**Trip Protection:**
- Trip cancellation up to $40,000
- Trip interruption up to $60,000 (150% of trip cost)
- Trip delay coverage after 6 hours: $2,100 per person
- Missed connections
- Trip inconvenience coverage

**Medical Coverage:**
- Emergency medical expenses: up to $250,000
- Emergency dental: covered
- Medical evacuation: up to $500,000
- Non-medical evacuation: up to $100,000

**Your Stuff:**
- Lost, stolen, or damaged baggage: up to $2,000 total
- Personal belongings: $150 per item
- Lost credit cards: reimbursement included

**Bonus Features:**
- 24/7 telemedicine access
- Real-time flight updates (often before airlines notify you)
- eSIM data plans for international trips
- Document storage in the app

## Optional Add-Ons

If you need extra coverage, Faye offers these upgrades:

| Add-On | Coverage Details |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR)** | Up to 75% reimbursement of trip costs; must purchase within 14 days of initial deposit; can cancel up to 48 hours before departure |
| **Rental Car Protection** | Coverage for collision, natural disasters, theft, vandalism |
| **Adventure Sports & Extreme Activities** | Up to $250,000 international / $50,000 domestic for activities like skydiving, bungee jumping, free diving |
| **Vacation Rental Damage** | Up to $3,000 for unintentional property damage |
| **Pet Care** | $2,500 in vet expenses OR $250 in kenneling costs if you return home late |

The CFAR coverage is particularly interesting. Most competitors only reimburse 50% if you cancel for any reason – Faye offers up to 75%. That's a real difference if you're insuring an expensive trip.

## What Does This Actually Cost?

Faye's pricing typically runs between 5-7% of your total trip cost. Here are some real examples from late 2025:

| Trip Details | Trip Cost | Insurance Cost | Percentage |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Colorado to Hawaii (family) | $2,000 | $269.77 | ~13.5% |
| Colorado to Hawaii (family) | $5,000 | $361.34 | ~7.2% |
| Arizona to Italy (2 weeks, solo) | $2,000 | $140.60 | ~7% |
| New York to UK (2 weeks, family of 4) | $12,000 | ~$840 | ~7% |

A few notes on pricing:
- Costs vary based on destination, trip length, traveler age, and total trip value
- Domestic trips generally cost less than international
- You can adjust your "total trip cost" to only cover what you're not comfortable losing
- Add-ons increase the price but might be worth it for your situation

## The Claims Process (This Is Where Things Get Good)

Remember that scenario about your luggage going missing at 2 AM in Tokyo? Here's what actually happens with Faye:

You file a claim through the app. Right there, in the moment. Upload a photo of the baggage claim ticket, maybe a photo of your empty hands looking sad at the airport carousel. Done.

Then money appears in your Faye Wallet – a digital card that works with Apple Pay or Google Pay. Not in three weeks. Not after seventeen follow-up emails. Pretty much immediately.

One customer reported getting reimbursed MORE than what they paid for the insurance itself after a flight cancellation caused them to miss their first hotel night. The app automatically notified them about the possible claim. They submitted documentation, got paid within days.

Most claims get resolved within 48 hours of receiving all necessary information. Compare that to the "4-6 weeks please stop calling us" timeline you get elsewhere.

## Real People Actually Using This

Trustpilot reviews sit at 5 stars from over 2,700 customers. That's... unusually high for an insurance company. Here's what people are actually saying:

One family needed help with a medical emergency during their vacation. The Faye team guided them through getting care in a foreign country, stayed in communication with the hospital, and checked in after they moved to their next destination. Their exact words: "We will never travel again without Faye."

Another traveler got sick while in Scotland over Christmas. Customer service agents helped find a doctor, get prescriptions filled, and stayed in touch throughout the process.

Someone else sprained their foot during a cruise. Filed a claim when they got home. Paid in full within a week.

Not everything is perfect – one review mentioned their claim taking over two months and requiring numerous phone calls. The app struggled with multiple receipts, they said. But that review stands out precisely because it's rare.

## The App Features Nobody Talks About

Beyond insurance stuff, the app includes:
- Real-time currency exchange rates
- Flight updates (seriously, sometimes before your airline knows)
- Secure storage for passport copies, travel documents, luggage photos
- Local emergency contacts for your destination
- Weather alerts
- Travel tips and destination information

One customer mentioned appreciating the "games/knowledge quizzes" in the app. I haven't verified this myself, but honestly, if my insurance company wants to help me kill time at the airport with trivia, I'm not complaining.

## Important Limitations to Know

Faye won't cover trips to: Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, or Yemen.

They only sell to U.S. residents (all 50 states plus DC). Not available for U.S. territories.

For pre-existing medical conditions coverage and the Cancel For Any Reason add-on, you must purchase within 14 days of your initial trip deposit.

Age matters for pricing – travelers over 70 pay more and may have reduced coverage limits.

## Is Faye Worth It?

Look, I'm not going to tell you travel insurance is mandatory for every single trip. Weekend road trip to the next state over? Probably fine to skip it.

But international travel? Expensive cruise? Trip with non-refundable deposits? That's when Faye makes sense.

The actual insurance coverage is competitive with higher-tier plans from traditional providers. The difference is Faye delivers it through technology that doesn't make you want to throw your phone across the room.

Claims get processed quickly. Customer service responds at 2 AM when you need them. The app actually helps instead of just existing to check a box that says "we have an app."

Plus, having insurance isn't just about the money. It's about that 3 AM phone call when something goes wrong in a country where you don't speak the language. It's about knowing someone competent has your back. Faye seems to understand that part better than most.

## Final Thoughts

Faye basically took an industry that hasn't changed much in decades and dragged it into the present. Digital-first, fast claims, actual human support when you need it, and pricing that doesn't make you feel like you're getting robbed.

Is it perfect? No. Will it solve every possible travel disaster? Also no. But it's solid coverage delivered in a way that actually works for how people travel now.

Worth checking out before your next trip. At minimum, 👉 [get a quote](https://www.withfaye.com) and see what it would cost. Might surprise you.

And if you do end up buying it, maybe you won't need to use it at all. That's kind of the point. But if your luggage disappears in Tokyo at 2 AM, you'll be really glad you did.
